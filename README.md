# BitAxeHexCAD
Exported the board KiCAD from official Github and added heatsink, display, and power terminals for current best approximations to build around. In BitAxe fashion, I am posting this for others to use. 

If you find it useful, a few sats for my time to put this together would be greatly appreciated.

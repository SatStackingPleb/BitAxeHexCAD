# BitAxeHexCAD
Exported the board KiCAD from official Github and added heatsink, display, and power terminals for current best approximations to build around. 

The multichip projects intrigue me very much and I think this is where we can get real creative with cooling and enclosure configurations.

If you find it useful, a few sats for my time to put this together would be greatly appreciated.
